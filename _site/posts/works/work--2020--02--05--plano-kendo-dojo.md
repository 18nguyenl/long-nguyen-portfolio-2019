Plano Kendo is a Kendo dojo where people of all ages and backgrounds can come and understand the beauty of Kendo. Originally, kendo was kenjutsu, a sword martial art used by ancient samurai. Today, kendo exists as a martial art to preserve the physical and mental discipline of kenjutsu. Plano Kendo exists as a place to bridge this tradition to people in a fun, powerful way.

## The Design

For me, this meant that I had to design a website that was welcoming to anyone who entered. It has to be fun, not intimidating. I noticed that on Dribble, designers and people tend to think sword = dangerous, violent, serious, formal, and clean. While other dojos may focus on that, Plano Kendo is all about the freedom and fun, so I started off designing my website in blue and rectangles.
